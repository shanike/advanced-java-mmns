1. mmn_14: question2: I created a custom utility class to create and handle a popup in JavaFX. 
The class supports cancel and/or save buttons - so it's called `class ActionButton`.
The class provides an easy-to-create title, text field with/without a label, cancel and/or save buttons and any extra self-implemented content to add to the popup.
